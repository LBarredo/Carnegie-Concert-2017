A native of Tel Aviv, Israel, Daniel Hass is an up and coming young cellist currently residing in Toronto and New York City. He has received training at the Israel Conservatory, the Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto, and the New England Conservatory in Boston. In the spring of 2017 Daniel graduated from the Juilliard School under the tutelage of Joel Krosnick as a recipient of the Kovner Fellowship. Daniel has played with a number of orchestras in Israel, Canada, and the United States, including the Israel Camerata Orchestra, the Toronto Symphony Orchestra, the National Youth Orchestra of Canada, and the Baltimore Chamber Orchestra. In the summer of 2016 Daniel brought home two major awards, the $25,000 Michael Measures Award from the Canada Council of the Arts, and the First Prize at the Stulberg International String Competition. An avid chamber musician, Daniel has performed with various ensembles around the world, traveling to Amsterdam, Budapest, Lisbon, Montreal, and Stanford. Travels have also brought Daniel to international masterclasses, where he has played for Gary Hoffman, Ralph Kirshbaum, Frans Helmerson, Janos Starker, and Leon Fleisher. Since the age of 13, Daniel spends his summers at the Perlman Music Program, where he studies with Ron Leonard and Paul Katz. Daniel plays on a 1914 Eugenio Degani Cello on loan through the course of his education.
