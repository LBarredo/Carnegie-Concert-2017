Gabriel Chakarji is a young pianist and composer who is deeply passionate and committed to music as a cultural expression. Originally from Caracas, Venezuela, he grew up in a multicultural environment full of music that expands from afro-Venezuelan Folk, Caribbean, and Brazilian music to Jazz and Gospel. At the age of 21 Gabriel moved to New York with a scholarship to study at the New School for Jazz and Contemporary Music under the guidance of great masters such as Reggie Workman, George Cables, Billy Harper, and Jane Ira Bloom. He quickly became active in the scene of the city performing in the most famous venues and concert halls. Gabriel was a Latin Grammy nominee for his participation on the album Tiempo by Linda Briceño. He has also toured Europe, Africa, and South America. The influences of cultures, rhythms, and harmonies became Gabriel’s own personality. His compositions and playing are rooted in social justice and multiculturalism.
