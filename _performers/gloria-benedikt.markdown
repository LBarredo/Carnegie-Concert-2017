Gloria Benedikt was born in Austria and trained at the Vienna State Opera Ballet School and English National Ballet School, London. Since 2002 she has worked as a dancer and choreographer across Europe and the USA. A graduate of Harvard University (2013), she is particularly interested in connecting the arts and academia, defining her dance pieces as choreographed papers and creating artistically innovative, impact-driven arts projects that link the humanities and sciences to solve global challenges. She is an Associate for Science and Arts at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA). Recent performance engagements include the Kennedy Center, Washington (DC); the House of the European Union, Vienna; the European Culture Forum, Brussels; the European Forum, Alpbach; the Bridging Europe Festival, Budapest; the European Commission's Joint Research Center, Ispra; and the Forum on European Culture, Amsterdam. www.gloriabenedikt.com
