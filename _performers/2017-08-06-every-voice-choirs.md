Every Voice Choirs was created at Columbia University Teachers College by Music Education faculty Dr. Nicole Becker and Dr. Jeanne Goffi-Fynn in 2012. Since then it has expanded to comprise three choirs for singers ages 7-16 at Teachers College and a satellite program at Hunter College Campus Schools. The mission of EVC is to help young people discover their voices and share them with pride. Under Dr. Becker's leadership, EVC’s choirs have performed at Carnegie Hall, Merkin Hall, Madison Square Garden, Manhattan School of Music, and Columbia University. The Concert Choir, EVC’s only auditioned ensemble, collaborates with artists throughout New York, most recently performing the world premiere of Zaid Jabri’s A Garden Among the Flames with the Cecilia Chorus of New York and Orchestra at Carnegie Hall in May, 2017.
