Ramsis Kassis is an oud soloist, composer, and songwriter who lives in Haifa. His musical talent started to surface at the age of six when he began studying western classical music mainly playing the piano. He went on to pursue studying Arabic music independently. In 2001, Ramsis entered the Academy of Music in Jerusalem where he completed his undergraduate studies summa cum laude, specializing in the oud. Today, in addition to his musical projects, Ramsis teaches future generations of musicians at the Beit Almusica conservatory in Shefa-Amr. In addition, he is an experienced composer of music for the theatre. His debut project, “Dajal,” combines two of his compositions: “Birth” and “Deception.”
