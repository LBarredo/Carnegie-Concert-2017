Lauren Siess began viola studies at age 11, after starting her musical studies on guitar and violin.  Lauren is currently an undergraduate violist at Juilliard as a student of Carol Rodland.  A native of Portland, Oregon, her former teachers include Brian Quincey, Helen Callus, and Paul Neubauer.  An alumni of Colburn Music Academy, Lauren was featured as soloist with the Colburn Academy Virtuosi Orchestra and Colburn Chamber Orchestra, and served as principal viola of both orchestras.  
Lauren has been a member of the Perlman Music Program since 2012.  During summer of 2017, Lauren attended Banff Centre’s “Ensemble Evolution,” and “Chamber Music,” programs, where she studied contemporary chamber music works with ICE, JACK Quartet, Imani Winds and Miro Quartet.  Lauren will be attending the Yellow Barn Program during summer of 2018.  
Passionate about community engagement, Lauren has created and participated in numerous musical/artistic outreach projects.  In summer 2017, Lauren co-founded the Joining Hands Project with violinist Leerone Hakami, where they taught music at schools in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.  Her and Leerone also presented a workshop/masterclass at Pacific University, titled “Research in the Performing Arts,” on diverse ways of building community engagement projects involving music.  In spring 2018, her quartet, the Uhuru Quartet, conducted a workshop at the WIN (Women in Need) Shelter in NYC, and later presented a program of all women-composers as a benefit concert for the WIN Shelter.  
Lauren is a proud recipient of a Kovner Fellowship at the Juilliard School.
