---
Israeli composer and musician Ronen Shapira’s new work The Five Continents explores the theme of partnership. It’s a concerto for piano (and keyboard) accompanied by a string quintet and ethnic instruments. The music reflects the musical traditions of the five world regions (the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceana) and the interaction between them, demonstrating the unity of humanity through music.
