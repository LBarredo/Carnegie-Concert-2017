artist: Ronen Shapira
---
This is the world premiere of Ronen Shapira’s The Five Continents, a composition exploring the theme of international harmony and partnership. A concerto for piano and keyboard, this digi-oriental piece uses conflict to demonstrate both the diversity and unity of humanity through music. The piece reflects upon the musical traditions and interactions of the five world regions (the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceania). The composition is a "Wild Prayer" creation of "Ancient Future” frequencies of sound, even featuring a light Morse frequency. This music is a non-constant creation, in search for meaning and awareness, and will therefore continue to grow and change after its performance. The composition mixes and melds oriental scales and aesthetics into moderiental (Modern-Oriental), Weast (West+East) language, and strives for a balance between the technological world and nature.
