Together with Jan Driessen and Killian Elbers, activist composer Merlijn Twaalfhoven translated climate change data from the Northern hemisphere into music to create this striking vocal piece. The piece is true to the data, and the vocals are a direct reflection of the changes in our climate since the beginning of measurement in 1880 until spring 2017. This piece pushes a well-known graph from a visual to an auditory experience, ending intensely with one highly pitched tone. In this way, we can relate freshly to the story the data is telling us, surpassing the overly politicized and polarized tone which surrounds this topic.

In _Four Drifting Seasons_ each vocal group represents a season, with low voices singing the winter, middle voices the spring and autumn, and soprano voices the summer. The occurrence of extreme weather events like floods and storms are expressed through articulation, dynamics and percussive sounds.

Since the music is neither melodic nor conventional, it is difficult to perform. To ensure accuracy the team developed an app to support singers in finding the exact during the performance. Instructions, examples and a manual can be found on the website [www.twaalfhoven.net](http://www.twaalfhoven.net).

Dutch composer Merlijn Twaalfhovenâ€™s work explores audience engagement through interactive concerts and the innovative use of singers and choirs. His work further engages musicians and other artists more directly in society. He won the Young Artist UNESCO Award for intercultural dialogue in 2011.
