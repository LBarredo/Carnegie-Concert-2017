Symphony No. 3 represents a major milestone in the history of music and is one of Beethoven’s most celebrated works. It is one of the pieces written in Beethoven’s middle period, which was characterized by greater freedom of expression and creativity. Further, it represents the noblest works of humanity, and is therefore in dialogue with the high aspirations of the Sustainable Development Goals.

German composer Ludwig van Beethoven lived from 1770 to 1827, and his work figured greatly in the transition from the Classical to the Romantic era in Western music. Other well-known works include the Sonata quasi una fantasia or Moonlight Sonata for piano, nine symphonies, two masses, and the opera Fidelio.
