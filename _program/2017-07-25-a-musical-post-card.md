The Musical Postcard Project connects young musicians and composers across large distances, to collaboratively express their dreams and vision about the world of 2030 through music. A network of music professionals in New York and Amsterdam work with music schools and refugee camps around the world, and especially in communities affected by conflict, climate change, migration, and poverty. Young, local musicians speak up and share their most personal statements through a short music video. These “Musical Postcards” travel to school classes in other countries where teenagers compose a short composition based on the original song or melody. These compositions are also performed by virtuoso professional musicians, bringing the perspectives of the new generation to a broad concert audience. Recordings of the performance are sent back to the young composers, empowering them to develop their personal expression of a vision for the future.
