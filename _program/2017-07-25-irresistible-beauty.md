Composer Viktor Ullmann was born in Silesia in the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1898. He briefly served in the military during WWI before leaving to study music with Sch√∂nberg in Vienna and Alexander von Zemlinsky in Prague. He worked in several European cities until WWII broke out. Of Jewish descent, Ullmann was deported to the Theresienstadt concentration camp in 1942, sent on to Auschwitz in 1944, and killed. The piece is a vehicle to explore the themes of SDGs 5 and 10 (gender equality & social inclusion).
