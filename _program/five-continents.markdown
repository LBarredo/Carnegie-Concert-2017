---
Israeli composer and musician Ronen Shapira’s new work The Five Continents explores the theme of partnership. A concerto for piano and keyboard, the music reflects the musical traditions of the five world regions (the Americas, Europe, Africa, Asia, and Oceana) and the interaction between them, demonstrating the unity of humanity through music.

Shapira holds a B.A. from the Tel Aviv Academy of Music, an M.A. in Jazz from Michigan University, and a Ph.D. from Northwestern University. He is the recipient of the Israeli Prime Minister’s Prize in Composition. His compositions are known for inventing new types of aesthetics and moods through the blending of western, middle-, and far-eastern sounds to produce new multicultural connections.
