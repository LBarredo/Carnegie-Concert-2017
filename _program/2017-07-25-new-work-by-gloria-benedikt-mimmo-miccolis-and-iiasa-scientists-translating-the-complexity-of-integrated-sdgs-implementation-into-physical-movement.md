title: "NEW WORK by Gloria Benedikt, Mimmo Miccolis and\_IIASA\_scientists\_translating the complexity of integrated SDGs\_implementation\_into physical movement"
artist: Merlijn Twaalfhoven
---
How are countries and the world community navigating potential trade-offs and collaborating to harness synergies? How can we ensure that progress in one area does not constrain progress in another? Concluding the concert, this new dance-science piece will be an artistic translation on the integration of all dimensions of sustainability. Inspired by problems, drivers, and impacts which arise from achieving the SDGs, it explores the question whether we have what it takes to achieve sustainability. The piece is developed and choreographed by Gloria Benedikt, Dancer, Choreographer and Associate for Science and Art at the International Institute for Applied Systems Analysis (IIASA) in collaboration with Italian dancer and choreographer Mimmo Miccolis, Dutch composer Merlijn Twaalfhoven, and IIASA scientist Frank Sperling.
